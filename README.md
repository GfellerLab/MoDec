# MoDec

MoDec is a motif deconvolution software that finds the motifs and corresponding
binding core offsets desribing the data in a list of peptides. It is described
in the publication (available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0289-6)):  

Racle, J., et al. Robust prediction of HLA class II epitopes by deep motif
deconvolution of immunopeptidomes. *Nat. Biotechnol.* 37, 1283â€“1286 (2019).

## Installation

1) Download MoDec-1.2.zip file and move it to a directory
of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip MoDec-1.2.zip package.

3) (Optional) In order to make an html report of the runs from MoDec and to
  draw the logos from each motifs, you need R and some R-packages:
   1. Rscript needs to be in your path.
   2. You need to install the R-package *ggseqlogo*, based on the fork
      found at <https://github.com/GfellerLab/ggseqlogo>.
      For this, from within R, type the command: `devtools::install_github("gfellerlab/ggseqlogo")`
   3. You also need the R-package *htmlTable* that can be found at
      <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmlTable/index.html>. Command
      to install from within R: `install.packages("htmlTable")`
   4. You then finally need to open the file *make_logo_report.R*, locate
      the line starting with `.libPaths` in this file and replace the
      `"PATH/TO/R/LIBRARIES"` by the path where you installed these R-packages.

4) To test your installation, make sure you are in *MoDec-1.2* directory and
   run the following command, depending on your operating system:

   * Mac OS:   `./MoDec -i test/testData.txt -o test/test_out --Kmax 5 --MHC2 --nruns 2 --makeReport`

   * Unix:  `./MoDec_unix -i test/testData.txt -o test/test_out --Kmax 5 --MHC2 --nruns 2 --makeReport`

   * Windows:   `MoDec.exe -i test/testData.txt -o test/test_out --Kmax 5 --MHC2 --nruns 2 --makeReport`

   Running the software can take few minutes depending on data size and number
   of motifs. If you didn't do the optional step (3) above, the `--makeReport`
   option shouldn't be used as MoDec won't be able to build this report.

   Your folder *test_out* should contain the same elements than *out_compare*
   folder (with few differences about the timing and file location indicated
   within the results files; the motifs found in *test_out/test_out_report.html*
   and *out_compare/test_out_report.html* should be highly similar but there can
   be small differences due to the random initial conditions that rely on
   different random number generators in the various operating systems - note
   that also the order of the motifs can differ due to these different random
   number generators).

   The *testData.txt* file corresponds to HLA-II peptidomics data from
   meningioma tissues obtained in our study (sample *3869-GA*, with 5987
   unique peptides).

5) (Optional) To run MoDec from anywhere on your computer, make an alias of
   MoDec executable (see above for which one depending on operating system) or
   add it in your path.

## Running

### Command

```bash
MoDec -i input_file -o output_name [additional options]
```

* Depending on your operating system, use Modec, MoDec_unix or MoDex.exe as
  indicated in the installation instructions.
* Do not use spaces in your file or directory names.
* Do not use other special characters (e.g., *, ?, %, &,...) in file or
  directory names.

### Required arguments

* Input file (command `-i` or `--input`):
File listing all the peptides with one peptide per line. It can also be a fasta
file (lines starting with ">" are skipped).

* Output name (command `-o` or `--output`):
The name of the output for the current run (including the path where to save it).
MoDec will create a folder of this name and save all results in this folder.

### Optional arguments

* `--Kmin 1` and/or `--Kmax 6`:
  To run MoDec searching for motifs between the *Kmin* value (default is 1) and
  *Kmax* value (default is 6).

* `-L 9` or `--Lmotif 9`:
  To search for motifs of the given length (default is 9).
  A value of 0 makes that we use a motif length equal to the longest peptide
  from the input data (and all peptides shorter that the longest are removed
  in this case).

* `--MHC2` or `--MHCII` or `--MHC-II`:
  This is an option recommended when working on MHC-II / HLA-II peptidomics
  data, to override some default parameters with those recommended in this
  case (it is equivalent to using the options `--pepLmin 12 --specInits`). When
  the options MHC2 and pepLmin are given, the pepLmin option value will have
  preference.

* `--pepLmin 12`:
  To remove from the input the peptides shorter than this length (default is equal
  to the motif length). **For HLA-II peptidomics, we recommend using a value of
  12, to remove potential HLA-I contaminants often present in the data**.

* `-r 20` or `--nruns 20`:
  To make this number of runs for the deconvolution with each selected number
  of motifs (default is 20).

* `-b 1` or `--nruns_out 1`:
  To output the results from this number of the best runs (by default we just
  output the results from the best run but can also output more). When this is
  used, the standard *report.html* still contains only the best results while
  another *..._report_multiRuns.html* file is created showing the results from
  the various runs.

* `--specInits`:
  To perform the computations based on multiple types of initial condition biases
  (e.g. performing some runs with a hydrophobic preference at P1). **This is
  recommended for HLA-II peptidomics** to increase the chances of finding the best
  motifs representing the data. When this is used, MoDec will run in fact 5 times
  more runs than what is given by the option `--nruns` (this is why the result
  summary files and *report.html* indicate a *n_runs_input* and *n_runs_real*
  value).

* `--makeReport`:
  To make an html report containing the logos found in the best run from each
  number of motifs (need to have R installed and *ggseqlogo* as described in
  step 3 above).

* `-y 3` or `--logoYmax 3`:
  Only useful with `--makeReport`. To define the max y value for the plots of
  the logos (default is 3).

* `--no_flat_mot`:
  When used, MoDec will not include a flat motif representing contaminant peptides.

* `--out_fullResp`, `--out_w_ks`:
  To output some additional files giving the full responsibilities of each
  peptides and the full weight of the motifs.

* `--no_bestPepResp`:
  When used, we don't output the file containing the best responsibility from
  each peptide (by default this file is outputted).

* `--outAdd`:
  Normally, MoDec will not run if the folder given in the `--output` argument
  already existed. When this option is used, MoDec will still run. **This option
  is to use with care**: previous results might get overwritten as it is using same
  file names, and, if different parameters are used for the different runs, the
  report html file will only indicate one of the sets of parameters used, without
  warning. This option is useful when launching MoDec for different numbers of
  motifs (`Kmin`, `Kmax` arguments): in such a case the results won't be
  overwritten as the output has a different name for each number of motifs
  searched for.

* `--seed 38230811`:
  To give an initial seed for the random number generator used by MoDec (default
  value is 38230811). When using the seed value 0, MoDec will try using a fully
  random seed or use the current time if such fully random device isn't available.

* `--log`:
  To make that MoDec outputs its logs to a log file created in the result folder
  instead of outputting it to the terminal.

* `-k 9` or `--kmer 9`:
  The kmer size used when comparing input peptides to give weights on each
  peptide based on the similarity between each of the input peptides. Use a
  value of 0 if you do not want to give any weight on peptides (default is a
  value equal to *Lmotif*, which is recommanded for HLA-II peptidomics where
  many peptides are highly similar, coming from the same protein but often
  trimmed at other positions).

* `-a ACGT` or `--alphabet ACGT`:
  The letters allowed in the alphabet. This is used if we want to run MoDec on
  other letters than the 20 standard amino acids, for example to apply it to
  nucleotides. By default it corresponds to *ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY* but if using
  the 20 standard AAs, it is better not to use this option because for the moment
  it would disable some specific settings that are only available in the standard
  case.

* `-u X` or `--unk_aa X`:
  Defines the letter used to describe an unknown amino acid in the sequences (by
  default it is *-*). This should be a single letter, if more than one letter is
  given, only the first one is used. The unk_aa are treated differently in the
  computation.

* `-c chemistry` or `--col_scheme chemistry`:
  Defines the color scheme used by ggseqlogo if making an html report of the
  results. Available schemes depend on ggseqlogo version, but should include
  *auto* (default value), *chemistry*, *chemistry2*, *hydrophobicity*,
  *nucleotide*, *nucleotide2*, *base_pairing*, *clustalx*, *taylor* and *modified*.

* `--theta_norm 1`:
  Tells which type of background frequency normaization to use for the theta
  (it tells which type of *f* to use in equation (1) from our paper). For the
  moment, these values are available:
  * 0: no normalization, all AA have an equal weight;
  * 1: estimate of background frequencies in HLA-II peptidomics data (default
       value, recommended for HLA-II data);
  * 2: AA frequencies from the human proteome;
  * 3: AA frequencies computed based on the current dataset - i.e. frequencies
       from AA found in all peptides from the dataset.
  * 4: estimate of background frequencies in MHC-II peptidomics data from mice.
  Note that when the *alphabet* is given, the only possible values are 0 and 3.

* `--flat_freq 2`:
  Tell which type of frequency to use for the flat motif (corresponds to the
  *h_i* frequency used for *theta^0_l,i* in equation (1) from our paper). The
  possible values are the same as for *theta_norm* above (default value is *2*).
  Note that when the *alphabet* is given, the only possible values are 0 and 3.

* `-S 0`, `--Salign 0`:
  A switch telling how to count to motif offset *alignment* S, giving more
  weights to motifs found at similar locations along the sequences:
  * 0: consider centered motifs independent of peptide size;
  * 1: count from the N-terminal of the sequences;
  * 2: count from the C-terminal of the sequences;
  * 3: do not consider offset preferences, i.e. motifs found anywhere along
      sequence will have same weight.

### Results returned and additional information

* MoDec creates a folder containing various files and subfolders with the results.
  
* The files *Summary/res_K.._out.txt* gives various information, like the
  parameters used in the current run, the final log-likelihood or a comparison
  between the motifs (PWM values) found in the various run (of this number
  of motifs - this comparison is found in the last lines, values correspond
  to Kullback-Leibler divergences between each motif from the best set of motifs
  and the set of motifs from each other run).

* The outputted PWMs (and corresponding logos in the report) correspond to
  the $\theta^{k}_{l,i}$ from equation (1) of our paper.

* The peptide responsibilities are returned in the
  *Responsibilities/bestPepResp_....txt* files. This gives for each peptide its
  two best responsibility values indicating to which motif and offset this
  corresponds as well as the corresponding core binding sequence.  
  With the option `--out_fullResp` it is possible to view the complete matrix
  of the peptide responsiblities (values from each peptide towards each motif
  and towards each binding core offset).

* The optimal number of motifs is difficult to automatically determine and
  existing measures provide unsatisfactory results. We use the Akaike
  Information Criterion (AIC) as a guide but we encourage the users to manually
  look at the motifs and determine the optimal number (AIC information is found
  in the html report and in *Summary/nMotScores....txt*).

* In the html report, the numbers indicated below each logo correspond to the
  number of peptides associated to this motif (assigning here each peptide
  to the motif towards which this peptide had its best responsibility value).
  The number in parenthesis next to it is the fraction of peptides assigned to
  this motif.

* The PWMs and logos of the flat motifs are also returned by MoDec.
